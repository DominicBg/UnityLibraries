# UnityLibraries

Collection of my personal libraries including

* A simple audio engine

* Some animation classes

* An object pooling with auto generated static string containing every object name in the pools.

* A singleton (from Unity)

* An Event manager

* GameEffects that helps with Freeze Frame/Screen shake and more

And more!
